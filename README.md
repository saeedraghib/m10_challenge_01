# *Unsupervised Learning - (m10_challenge_01):*<br><br>

## **Description:**<br>
In this Challenge, you’ll assume the role of an advisor in one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world. Competitors are fierce, so you want to propose a novel approach to assembling investment portfolios that are based on cryptocurrencies. Instead of basing your proposal on only returns and volatility, you want to include other factors that might impact the crypto market—leading to better performance for your portfolio.

When you present the idea, your manager loves it! So, you’re asked to create a prototype for submitting your crypto portfolio proposal to the company board of directors.

This project is designed to perform the following tasks:
<br>

### ***Task 1:***<br>
Import the Data.
<br>
### ***Task 2:***<br>
Prepare the Data.
<br>
### ***Task 3:***<br>
Cluster the cryptocurrencies.
<br>
### ***Task 4:***<br>
Find the best value for k.
<br>
### ***Task 5:***<br>
Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis.
<br>
### ***Task 6:***<br>
Visualize the Results.
